# AUNets

## VGG16 Architecture

## Network (VGG - Fig (a))
![](misc/VGG16-OF_None.png)

Other Optical Flow stream architectures are found in `misc` folder

## Requirements

- Python 2.7 
- PyTorch 0.3.1
- Tensorflow (only if tensorboard flag)
- Other modules in `requirements.txt`

## Weights (*.pth models*)

As each model can be as heavy as 1GB for a total of 36GB per network variant (12 AUs - 3 folds). Please feel free to create an issue asking for the weights, I will supply a temporal link to download them. I am doing this because I cannot keep open a link with at least ~40GB forever.
